## At-A-Glance

During the summer, I collaborated with Simulia's User Experience R&D team. My primary responsibility involved working closely with a senior UX designer on the traceability project. In this role, I conducted research and offered insights aimed at addressing the challenge of job traceability within Process Composer, a simulation software developed by Simulia.

## Overview

# What is Process Composer?
Process composer helps customers integrate applications, disciplines and data by including visualization of activities  in a complex process automation as a flow chart or diagram, using parallel or conditional branching to control which activities are executed and helps control the flow of data. It also enables the customer to automate their process to increase productivity, optimize and design exploration studies and democratize their process to allow for non experts to run the process with little or no training. Below is an overview of what the current state of the process composer looks like.

### Problems to solve

1. Users do not know how to recreate the results when a Simulation
Process is run multiple times (inputs and configuration is unknown).
2. Initialized/original values of parameters & configuration of the
Simulation Process are lost when the process is run and job is created.
3. Users end up in an inaccurate/unknown state if they make changes to
the Simulation Process after running a job.
